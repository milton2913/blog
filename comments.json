Then I have to start working, may be the time will not be the exact when I will get the next position but by this I will have a map of my career which will guide me always.

A leader is someone who always inspires his co-workers to do better, helps them in their work, and always think out of the box, while a boss only thinks of his own profit, never do any work by himself, always pressurize his co-workers to do all the work and takes all the credits of their work. Mainly, a leader (positive) and a boss (negative) are two different people. So we should develop ourselves as a leader, not a boss in order to inspire growth, development of the team, and company.         \\r\\n\\r\\nSir, I have a question for you.\\r\\n How can young people act as leaders in order to make changes?\\r\\n\\r\\nNivedita Lodh Shreya\\r\\n253-45-065\\r\\nDepartment of Innovation and Entrepreneurship\", \"replies\": [], \"user_id\": 198491, \"comment_date\": \"2025-09-25 21:34:40.000000\", \"commented_by\": \"Nivedita Lodh Shreya\"}, {\"comment\": \"Thanks a lot Sir,..!!!\", \"replies\": [], \"user_id\": 198731, \"comment_date\": \"2025-09-27 20:10:23.000000\", \"commented_by\": \"Joyento Chandra\"}, {\"comment\": \"As a leadership graduate this course help me to to improve my quality.\", \"replies\": [], \"user_id\": 198352, \"comment_date\": \"2025-10-07 08:37:49.000000\", \"commented_by\": \"@marufhossain\"}, {\"comment\": \"I am very motivated , if I want to be a leader myself, what should I do first, sir?\\r\\n\\r\\nMd.

{"course_id":"54399","post_title":"Self-esteem & Be You","comments":"[{\"comment\": \"Some of us may have had similar unhappy moments - at home, at school, among peers and family. We believed the lie that we are not good enough. Some of us may have the best of beginnings, but a failure or a series of failures may have corroded our self-esteem. Still, some of us may have everything going in favor of us, but our constant negative self-talk could be harming.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhatever be the reason, there is a possibility of repairing your spirit and nurturing your lost self-esteem. Here are some tips to boost your low self esteem:\\r\\n\\r\\n1. Put a stop to victimhood\\r\\nThe more you think that you’ve been a victim of unfavorable circumstances and people, the weaker you feel. It is time to stop being the victim. See your past as a dream and look forward to the future with the roar of a lion!\\r\\n. Remove the baggage\\r\\nThe times you were bullied, the times you felt put down, and the instances of failure lend a damaging emotional baggage. Emotions attached to every distasteful memory damage the foundation of one’s self-esteem. Dropping them becomes essential for nurturing self-confidence. But, how do you drop emotions that have ransacked your mind for so long? Through meditation!\\r\\n\\r\\nMeditation to boost self-esteem is a reality. The process not only clears your mind of distressing emotions but it also makes you comfortable with your self. When you are comfortable with your self, your self-confidence gets a tremendous boost.\\r\\n\\r\\n3. Curtail the negative self-talk\\r\\nSometimes it is our minds pulling us down with constant doubts and other negative self-talk. Instead of grumbling on your shortcomings, resolve to address them. Instead of indulging in any negative inner dialogue, observe them till they dissolve into oblivion.\\r\\n\\r\\n4. Compete with yourself\\r\\nCompeting with others sets off unrealistic expectations of ourselves - a tendency which produces a spiral of self-damaging thoughts. It is a tendency which neither makes us productive nor happy.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, if you compete with yourself, you’re not only more productive but can build a stronger self-esteem. So, strive to be better than the previous day and previous year rather than the fellow sitting next to you!\\r\\n\\r\\nBased on inputs from Amol Wagle and Seema Thanedar, faculties, The Art of Living\", \"replies\": [], \"user_id\": 0, \"comment_date\": \"2022-09-29 00:44:25.000000\", \"commented_by\": \"Golam Haider\"}, {\"comment\": \"Meditation105Meditation For You66\\r\\nMost Popular\\r\\nOUR MEDITATION COURSESahaj Samadhi MeditationEFFORTLESS .
